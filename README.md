> 📘 Part of the **AD490 Capstone Project**  
> Project hub / documentation: https://github.com/JesseCaddell/AD490-Capstone

This repository contains the **frontend web application** for the GitHub Workflow Automation SaaS.
The UI allows users to connect GitHub, select repositories, create automation rules, generate CI workflows,
and view activity logs.

## Scope (MVP)
- Repo selection + installation status
- Rules UI (create/edit/delete rules)
- Workflow builder UI (generate + preview YAML and apply to repo)
- Activity / audit log view (basic)

## Tech Stack (planned)
- Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- Hosted on Vercel (or equivalent)
- Calls the backend API for all GitHub operations

## Local Development (placeholder)
> Setup instructions will be added once the initial app skeleton is committed.
